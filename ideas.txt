The goal is to somehow figure out which characteristics reflect the personality traits best.
How to figure that out?

God knows

let's try feature extraction of the characters.

Idea: Figure out different features of characters in handwriting. Try to relate and see if there is any co-relation b/w any characteristics and any of the OCEAN traits. If so, by how much? (Later: is the effect causal?)

What are the different features? How do they pan out? etc. etc.
